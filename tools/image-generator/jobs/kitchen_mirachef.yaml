  STRICTLY front-facing, flat symmetrical view of the SAME Mirachai Mediterranean-Balkan style kitchen interior.
  Always keep the exact same layout and furniture across all variants.
  Style: semi-realistic painterly background with cinematic light, luminous natural colors,
  warm wooden textures, rustic Mediterranean charm. Subtle magical realism allowed (tiny sparkles in light, glowing steam),
  but understated. Strictly symmetrical, central vanishing point at the back wall. Do not crop or rotate.
  No people, no text, no logos.
