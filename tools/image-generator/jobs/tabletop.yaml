  STRICT top-down view of a rectangular wooden tea table.
  Camera centered directly above. Table surface fully visible with clean edges.
  The CENTER of the table must remain EMPTY (no objects placed).
  Objects only along the outer edges and corners. Arrangement organic and RANDOMIZED, never perfectly symmetrical.
  No tea tools or obvious brewing equipment; allow only small everyday bits (spoon, ice, citrus slice) if mentioned.
  Semi-realistic painterly rendering with soft hand-painted textures, rich wood grain, detailed textiles,
  lifelike plants/fruits/stones. Cozy, atmospheric, slight Ghibli/lofi inspiration but lifelike clarity.
  Lighting can be natural interior light; keep soft believable shadows, do not over-contrast.
