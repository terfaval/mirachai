items:
  - name: "desktop_background_hajnal"   # Dawn
    light: >
      Dawn light: pale sky outside, faint bluish early light filtering through the windows.
      Cool, gentle tones, very soft contrast. A tiny, faint standby glow on the record player only.

  - name: "desktop_background_reggel"   # Morning
    light: >
      Morning light: soft and fresh. Gentle highlights ripple across leaves and tabletops.
      Slight greenish bounce from outside foliage. Two steaming cups on the small table suggest a morning ritual.

  - name: "desktop_background_del"      # Noon
    light: >
      Noon light: bright, strong yet diffused sunlight filling the room evenly.
      Clear contrast without harsh clipping. In the sunbeams a subtle veil of floating dust motes is visible,
      softly sparkling in the air.

  - name: "desktop_background_delutan"  # Afternoon
    light: >
      Afternoon light: slightly warm tone. Longer, soft shadows stretching across the floor.
      Calm, relaxed atmosphere, balanced exposure across the room.

  - name: "desktop_background_este"     # Evening golden hour
    light: >
      Evening golden hour: warm amber light pours through the windows, long soft shadows.
      Add a small table lamp near the record player at **low intensity (~10–15%)**;
      the lamp gently accents surfaces without overpowering the sunset.

  - name: "desktop_background_ejszaka"  # Night
    light: >
      Night: outside dark. Turn on only low, warm practical lights:
      two pendant lights and a subtle countertop lamp at **low intensity (5–15%)**.
      Create small pools of amber light around the record player and tea kitchen; overall dim, intimate atmosphere,
      deep yet readable shadows; no blown highlights.
