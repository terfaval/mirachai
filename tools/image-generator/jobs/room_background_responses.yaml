  Urban Scandinavian–bohemian teahouse interior, FULL ROOM wide composition.

  STRUCTURE:
  - LEFT WALL: a large window with thin wooden frames dividing it into 6 panes.
    Through the window: leafy balcony plants and the sky visible above urban greenery.
  - BACK WALL: a long wooden counter with a vintage vinyl record player in the center,
    surrounded by teasets, jars, and books.
    Above and beside: shelves filled with plants (trailing vines, hanging pots, upright greens),
    intermixed with framed tea-themed posters, vintage teabox illustrations,
    and Asian calligraphy for "tea".
  - RIGHT WALL: open shelving with cups, teapots, brewing tools, stacked boxes, and more plants.
    A narrow wooden door on the far right wall.
  - FLOOR: a large colorful woven rug (muted red, blue, and green tones in traditional geometric style),
    placed at the center; the rug’s size, design and position remain identical across all variants.
  - SEATING: low tea tables with floor cushions; along the window wall, a simple padded wooden bench.

  MATERIALS:
  - Pale wood for furniture, shelves, and window frames.
  - Matte stone or concrete counter base.
  - Paper-like walls, light linen fabrics.
  - Industrial pendant lamps: two round, black metal shades with downward-facing covers.

  DECOR:
  - Plants abundant but varied, not jungle-like; spilling softly from shelves and corners.
  - Framed artworks: tea-themed posters, botanical tea illustrations, calligraphy.
  - Cozy details but not cluttered.

  CAMERA / PERSPECTIVE:
  - Wide-angle but natural perspective, slightly pulled back and at a higher viewpoint.
  - Show more ceiling with pendant lamps and more wooden floor with the colorful rug.
  - Depth of the room visible, immersive interior perspective.
  - Framing remains identical horizontally; do not add new objects at the side edges.
  - Only extend visible vertical space (ceiling and floor).

  LIGHTING RULE:
  - Daytime: abundant natural daylight through the window, shadows across the colorful rug.
  - After dusk: warm pendant lamps and lit candles on tables and counter.
  - Shadows and highlights respond naturally to the time of day.

  RENDERING STYLE:
  Semi-realistic painterly look:
  Maintain warm hand-painted atmosphere but with more realistic details
  in wood grain, fabric textures, pottery shine, and plant leaves.
  Still soft, cozy, slightly Ghibli/lofi inspired, but less stylized and more lifelike.
